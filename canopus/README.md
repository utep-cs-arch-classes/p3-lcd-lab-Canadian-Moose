Project 2: Blinky Toy
====================

This program will connect to an MSP430 board in order to manipulate the LEDs and switches.

## Features

Upon running the program the red LED will brighten and dim.

The program will also enable the p1 switch. This will control the state machine. <br>
The green LED will change states from blinking at one second intevals to blinking the pattern for `SOS` if the switch is held. 

The function that contains the `SOS` blink pattern is also the function that has been converted to `Assembly` for this project.
